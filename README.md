## Project Rubric

**Writeup** <br>
**Criteria:** Provide a writeup (aka this README file) <br>
**Meets Specifications:**  The README should include a statement and supporting figures / images that explain how each rubric item was addressed, and specifically where in the code each step was handled.

**Notebook Analysis**<br>
**Criteria:** Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with test data provided, next on data you have recorded).  Add/modify functional to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.<br>
**Meets Specifications:** Describe in your writeup (and identify where in your code) how you modified or added functions to add obstacle and rock sample identification.

**Criteria:** Populate the `process_image ()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test ddata using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result.<br>
**Meets Specifications:** Describe in your writeup how you modified the `process_image()` to demonstrate your analysis and how you created a worldmap.  Include your video output with your submission.
