## Project:  Search and Sample Return
In this project, you will write code to autonomously map a simulated environment and search for samples of interests.

## Install

## Code
Open file.py

## Run
Make sure you are in the top-level project directory smartcab/ (that contains this README). Then run: <br>
python folder/file.py <br>

## Project Rubric

**Writeup** <br>
**_Criteria:_** Provide a writeup (aka this README file) <br>
**Meets Specifications:**  The README should include a statement and supporting figures / images that explain how each rubric item was addressed, and specifically where in the code each step was handled.

**Notebook Analysis**<br>
**Criteria:** Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with test data provided, next on data you have recorded).  Add/modify functional to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.<br>
**Meets Specifications:** Describe in your writeup (and identify where in your code) how you modified or added functions to add obstacle and rock sample identification.

**Criteria:** Populate the `process_image ()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test ddata using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result.<br>
**Meets Specifications:** Describe in your writeup how you modified the `process_image()` to demonstrate your analysis and how you created a worldmap.  Include your video output with your submission.

**Criteria:** Fill in the `perception_step()` (at the bottom of the `perception.py` script) in (`decision.py`) functions in the autonomous mapping scripts and an explanation is provided in the writeup of how and why these functions were modified as they were.<br>
**Meets Specifications:** `perception_step()` and `decision_step()` functions have been filled in and their functionality explained in the writeup.
