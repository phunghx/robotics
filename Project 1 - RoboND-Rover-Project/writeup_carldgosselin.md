## Project 1: Search and Sample Return

**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**  

**Training / Calibration**  

* Download the simulator and take data in "Training Mode"
* Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided
* Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)
* Fill in the `process_image()` function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The `output_image` you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.
* Use `moviepy` to process the images in your saved dataset with the `process_image()` function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.

**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**

* Fill in the `perception_step()` function within the `perception.py` script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update `Rover()` data (similar to what you did with `process_image()` in the notebook). 
* Fill in the `decision_step()` function within the `decision.py` script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the `perception_step()` in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands. 
* Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.

## [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/916/view)

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

### Notebook Analysis
#### 2. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.

Added/ modified functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.

Finding rocks...

```
def find_rocks(img, levels=(110, 110, 50)):
    rockpix = ((img[:,:,0] > levels[0]) \
              & (img[:,:,1] > levels [1]) \
              & (img[:,:,2] < levels[2]))
    
    color_select = np.zeros_like(img[:,:,0])
    color_select[rockpix] = 1
    
    return color_select

rock_map = find_rocks(rock_img)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,3))
plt.subplot(121)
plt.imshow(rock_img)
plt.subplot(122)
plt.imshow(rock_map, cmap='gray')
```

Identifying obstacles...

```
def perspect_transform(img, src, dst):
           
    M = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(src, dst)
    warped = cv2.warpPerspective(img, M, (img.shape[1], img.shape[0]))# keep same size as input image
    mask = cv2.warpPerspective(np.ones_like(img[:,:,0]), M, (img.shape[1], img.shape[0])) #New
    return warped, mask #new
``` 

The following was also modified for obstacle detection...
```
# warped = perspect_transform(grid_img, source, destination)
warped, mask = perspect_transform(grid_img, source, destination)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,3)) #new
plt.subplot(121) #new
plt.imshow(warped)
plt.subplot(122) #new
plt.imshow(mask, cmap='gray') #new
```

#### 3. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. 
And another! 

1) Define source and destination points for perspective transform
2) Apply perspective transform
3) Apply color threshold to identify navigable terrain/obstacles/rock samples
4) Convert thresholded image pixel values to rover-centric coords
5) Convert rover-centric pixel values to world coords
6) Update worldmap (to be displayed on right side of screen)

### Autonomous Navigation and Mapping

#### 4. Fill in the `perception_step()` (at the bottom of the `perception.py` script) and `decision_step()` (in `decision.py`) functions in the autonomous mapping scripts and an explanation is provided in the writeup of how and why these functions were modified as they were.


#### 5. Launching in autonomous mode your rover can navigate and map autonomously.  Explain your results and how you might improve them in your writeup.  

**Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by `drive_rover.py`) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.**

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
